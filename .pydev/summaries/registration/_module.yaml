workflows:
- User submits registration data → Validate credentials → Create user account → Generate
  JWT tokens → Setup email verification → Return tokens or verification message
- 'Email verification flow: Send verification email → User clicks link → Verify email
  key → Redirect to success page'
notes: Uses atomic transactions for user creation, supports custom permission classes
  via Django settings, and handles email verification based on allauth configuration
